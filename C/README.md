# Exercise 1

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

This exercise highlights the importance of [size_t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWOeL1oymrc). It's an unsigned long long (**%zu**)!

# Exercise 2

A Narcissistic Number is a number of length n in which the sum of its digits to the power of n is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Ex: 153, where n = 3 (number of digits in 153)
13 + 53 + 33 = 153

Write a method is_narcissistic(i) which returns whether or not i is a Narcissistic Number.
