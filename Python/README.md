# Exercise 1 on Regex

Good lesson on the regex [**\Z** symbol.](https://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html) Python's support on some of these regex symbols does seem a tad wonky, though!

# Exercise 2

A triangle has different rows. Each row means how many odd numbers are in it. The starting point is on the website, but I've defined it in my function. The simpler solution is simply the cubic of the number of elements per row.

# Exercise 3

Filter strings out of iterable

# Exercise 4

Implement camel case

# Exercise 5

Decoding Morse code

# Exercise 6 FAILED

The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
